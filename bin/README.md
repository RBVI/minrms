## bin subdirectory

This directory contains binaries and executable scripts including the main
**minrms** program *(as well as several small additional programs)*.
Each directory corresponds to a different executable program.
To compile these programs, follow the
[installation instructions](../INSTALL.md).
After compilation, each program will be located in its own subdirectory.

**Note: These additional programs are probably not useful
for most users and can be ignored.**
*These additional programs were used to in the
[MINRMS paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btg035)
to assess the quality of the alignment and the similarity of the alignments
generated by minrms with sequence alignments generated by other programs.
Most users probably do not need to do this.*

- **minrms**
  Generates sequence
  alignments that minimize
  RMSD between matched residues.

- **align2msf**
  Converts Gerstein&Levitt's
  pairwise ALIGN server output to
  MSF format.

- **fssp2msf**
  Converts Holm&Sander's
  DALI server output (FSSP)
  to MSF format.

- **msf2sequence**
  Extracts a single sequence from
  one of the sequences aligned
  in an MSF-file.

- **msf2stat3d**
  Computes structural
  properties of an alignment
  like RMSD, P_str, and the
  orientation of minimal RMSD.
  Generates MIDAS GFX files.

- **msf_compare**
  Measures similarity between
  two alignments.

- **pdb2sequence**
  Extracts a sequence of residue
  1-letter codes, from a
  PDB-file.

- **rotate_pdb**
  Rotates the structure in a
  PDB file.  The input format is
  compatible with the data
  returned by msf2stat3d and
  minrms.

- **pdb_select**
  Generates a PDB file containing
  a subset of residues from
  another PDB file.
